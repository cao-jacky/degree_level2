# Determining the viscosity of water 

a lab report about determining the viscosity of water

## abstract

## introduction

Things to talk about here:

- How the equation is derived, Poiseuille’s Equation - find a reference for that 
	- how poiseuille found that provided the fluid is in streamlined motion (non-turbulent), the equation for volume flow rate through a tube of length L and radius a is (...)
- Water density variations with the temperature 
- The physics of viscosity
	- ideal fluid is incompressible and has no internal frication
	- internal friction (viscosity) causes shear stress when two adjacent layers of fluid move relative to each other
		- consider plate being dragged through viscous liquid: high speed on top of liquid, low speed at the bottom
		- layer/lamina which moves the plate -> the laminas slide over each other
		- streamlines? for laminar flow are smooth
		- force required to move the plate is proportional to the area of the plate and the velocity gradient
		- the proportionality factor is the viscosity \eta 
		- eqn: F/A = \eta dv_x/dz

## method
