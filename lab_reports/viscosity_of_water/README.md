## introduction

Things to talk about here:

- How the equation is derived, Poiseuille’s Equation - find a reference for that 
	- how poiseuille found that provided the fluid is in streamlined motion (non-turbulent), the equation for volume flow rate through a tube of length L and radius a is (...)
- Water density variations with the temperature 
- The physics of viscosity
	- ideal fluid is incompressible and has no internal frication
	- internal friction (viscosity) causes shear stress when two adjacent layers of fluid move relative to each other
		- consider plate being dragged through viscous liquid: high speed on top of liquid, low speed at the bottom
		- layer/lamina which moves the plate -> the laminas slide over each other
		- streamlines? for laminar flow are smooth
		- force required to move the plate is proportional to the area of the plate and the velocity gradient
		- the proportionality factor is the viscosity \eta 
		- eqn: F/A = \eta dv_x/dz

## method
- set-up of the experiment - firstly describe the equipment used and provide a nice figure to show it! 
- water holder/container thing, capillary tubes (three of them: blue, black, and red) were used/connected to the water container 
- beaker used to catch the water, this was on top of a set of measuring scales 
- pippet used to transfer water from beaker to measuring cylinder 

## results
- a table of data, include temperatures maybe?
- what does the results show?
- can our chi square values be improved? reduced? what??

## discussions
- discussion of the results
- provide a value for the written value of the viscosity of water
- comparison between values

- limitations of experiment
	- the tubes are not all the same size throughout - also don't know where the diameter of the tube begins, scratched around the diameter of the tube
	- air bubbles forming
	- tools for measuring isn't accurate? the ruler, vernier scale
	
- improvements on the experiment
	- water bath to keep constant temperature - temperature varied during data collection, the density of water changes with temperature
