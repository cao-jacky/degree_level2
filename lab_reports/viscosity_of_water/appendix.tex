and merge the resulting pdf file  with the one containing the

PDF Utilities $>$ PDF Split and Merge. Run PDF Split and Merge. In the left-hand column of the screen, click on Merge/Extract. Then simply add
your pdf documents to the list of files you want to merge, specify the destination output file, and run the program.
