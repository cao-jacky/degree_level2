The volume flow rate of a fluid can be expressed functionally as derived by Poiseuille and Hagen. This relationship can be rearranged so that the viscosity of a fluid can be experimentally determined. By performing analysis of data of the mass, volume, and heights, it is possible to calculate the viscosity of water, $\eta_{water}$. The average value obtained was determined to be $1.00 \pm 0.03$ mPa s which does not agree with the literature value, $1.679$ mPa s. [[mention accepting and why??]]

\section{Introduction} 
\vspace{-2ex} 

Derived experimentally by Poiseuille in 1838 and Hagen in 1839 \cite{poiseuillehagen}, the volume flow rate $dV/dt$ of a fluid passing through a tube can be expressed as a function of the density of the fluid $\rho$, the value for acceleration due to gravity $g$, the height the fluid leaves the tube $h$, the radius $a$ and length $L$ of the tube, and the viscosity of the fluid $\eta$,

\begin{equation} 
\frac{dV}{dt}=\frac{\pi}{8}\frac{\rho gh}{\eta}\frac{a^4}{L}. 
\label{pohagen}
\end{equation}

Noting that the group $\rho gh$ can be collectively termed the pressure difference $\Delta P$ between the two ends of the tube \cite{collegephysics}. [[?? add something more to here]]

If we consider that a fluid is flowing through said [[?]] tube, it experiences both friction with the inner wall and internal friction within itself. The latter can be defined more readily as the viscosity of the fluid $\eta$, and this results in shear stress when two adjacent layers (laminas) of fluid move relative to each other. 

We find that as $\eta$ increases, the volume flow rate decreases, the shear stress between two laminas becomes greater and so restricts the movement of the fluid's molecules trying to flow through the tube. 

Generally we can say that the lamina flow streamlines are smooth, top layers sliding over other laminas without the system having any turbulent motion - this condition is required for equation [\ref{pohagen}] to be valid. 

Using a rearranged form of the relation derived by Hagen and Poiseuille it is possible to experimentally calculate a value for the viscosity of water.

\section{Method} 
\vspace{-2ex}
A flow of water was created by fixing a capillary tube to a water tank. The tank was raised to an initial height arbitrary height above the work surface[?]. The tank was then filled up with water from heights 2cm to 16cm at 2cm intervals, these values were measured with the markings on the side of the tank. During this we had to ensure that we did not create parallax between the level of the water and the markings on the side. 

The water was then allowed to flow out of the tube for a period of 90s for each height of water, this time was measured using a digital stopwatch. As the water flowed out it was caught within a large beaker so that the mass and volume of it could be measured after the allotted time had passed. 

The mass was found by having the beaker already on a set of electronic scales and initially zeroed to account for the beaker's mass. The volume on the other hand required the water to be transferred from the beaker to a measuring cylinder, this was performed by using a pipette. Care was again taken so that there was no parallax and that no unaccounted water was left in the beaker. It was also necessary to clear the tube once air bubbles formed along the length of it, this reduced the flow rate of the water. The bubbles were cleared out using a long piece of copper wire.

\label{fig:fig1}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

An initial density value for water was calculated by taking four measurements of the volume and mass of the water, then calculating four values for $\rho_{water}$, and then averaging it so find a value. 

One set of data was taken for each of the three capillary tubes that were used. Each tube varied in their internal diameter. These values were calculated from multiple measurements taken using a travelling microscope along the horizontal axis. The total length of the tube, from end to end, was measured using a ruler. 

The collected data was then applied to a least squares fitting to create an initial linear model. The difference between the model and the data was then calculated, then this was divided by the uncertainty on the flow rate - this became our normalised residuals. Finally, these values were squared and summed up to a create a chi-squared value, then this was divided by the number of degrees of freedom to create the reduced chi-squared statistic. This analysis was performed to check if the model would hold true and if our data was accurate. After analysis three values of viscosity were calculated from the data.

\section{Results}
\vspace{-2ex}

The volumetric flow rate of water is plotted against the varying height, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fig2}. This flow rate was calculated by dividing each value of the measured volume with the measured time period. Using this data, a value of viscosity could be calculated through a rearranged form of equation [\ref{pohagen}],

\begin{equation} 
\eta=\frac{\pi \rho g a^4 }{8 L m}, 
\label{r-pohagen}
\end{equation}

where $m$ is the gradient of the least squares regression line, calculated with the known data for $dV/dt$ and $h$.

From preliminary results taking, our calculated value for the density of water, which was used in further calculations is ${1001 \pm 1}$ kgm$^{-3}$.

The calculated values for the viscosity of water are shown in Table \ref{table:1} with which respective tube was used, the radius, the reduced $\chi^2$, and the Durbin-Watson statistic ($\mathcal{D}$) for each of those tubes. 

An average value for viscosity can thus be found to be $1.00 \pm 0.03$ mPa s, which does not agree with the literature value \cite{crc}, $1.679$  mPa {s}.

\section{Discussion}
\vspace{-2ex}
From an initial inspection of Fig. \ref{fig:fig2} we see that the variations of $dV/dt$ with $h$ for the blue and red tubes do not appear to fully fit a linear regression model, there are deviations. At the same time, the black tube does appear to have a more closely followed linear trend. We can also see that the majority of the error bars for all three sets of data do not seem to be within the range of the lines of best fit. This implies that our data could be not entirely accurate, or that our initial assumption of the linearity in our data is not valid. [[?]]

We can further explore the validity of our data by looking at the calculated values for $\chi^2_{\nu}$. A reasonable fit to the model should see $\chi^2_{\nu}$ to be approximately one \cite{hughesandhayes}. For our data, the blue and red tubes have values which are not close to one at all, but with the black tube it is of a similar value. 

With our experimentation, we can consider that there were some limitations with how the data was collected. [[?]] For the volume of the water, it was likely that the $V$ we measured was not the actual value that had dripped out of the tank. This problem arose due to the fact that some water was left within the pipette when transferring from beaker to the measuring cylinder, and when the capillary tube was attached, the rubber seal was not perfectly air tight so water did leak out.

Another experimental limitation was that the diameter of each tube was not the same throughout, this was discovered when a copper wire was attempted to be slid down throughout the length of the tube to clear air bubbles which had formed. It was noticed that after a certain point, it was not possible to entirely pass the wire through. With this, we find that the implications [[?]] of this would be t

There was a systematic error in the LINEST model due to the values not being 0 and whatnot... 

Considerations of other factors were not taken into account with our calculations such as the variation in the density of water with temperature change \cite{dentemp}. While we did initially assume that the fluid was incompressible, analysis of the data shows that our model could be slightly altered, with this case, we can consider the density variation. [[?]] From the Thiesen-Scheel-Diesselhorst equation \cite{dentemp}, we see that as the temperature of water increases, the density of water decreases, meaning that the viscosity of water will decrease as a result. [[too much usage of water]] 

The arising of random errors can not be considered as n

The disparity between our calculated value of $\eta{water}$ and the literature value is because???
% should this paragraph be in here so early?
However, from Table \ref{table:1} we see that $\eta_{water}$ for each tube are in agreement within their experimental errors. While the model may not be correct, the values produced, which when averaged [are/are not] in agreement with literature values. 


The experiment was limited by difficulties in measurement, the amount of data unable to be taken - more data could have been taken to account for the temperature change maybe. Also repeat measurements so the mean and standard error could be used instead of trying to calculate values yourself. More time needed so more data, in the time given, only one set of data was taken for each tube so that different flow rates could be considered.
